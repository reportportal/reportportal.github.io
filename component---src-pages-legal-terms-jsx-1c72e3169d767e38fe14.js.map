Invoices for periods less than the\n              subscription term may occasionally be issued as a convenience, but an invoice does not\n              shorten a subscription term or give any early termination right to Customer.

Upon receipt of a Dispute Notice,\n              both parties will promptly make available appropriate personnel to work in good faith\n              to resolve the dispute within 15 days. Upon resolution of the dispute by the parties,\n              additional agreed amounts due from Customer, if any, in relation to the applicable\n              invoice must be remitted to Test IO within 10 days following such resolution.
