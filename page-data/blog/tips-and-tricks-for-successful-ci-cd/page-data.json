This is an important metric that shows how quickly a new feature goes into production. With perfect CI, this process can take just a few minutes. What do we need to deliver features with such speed?

This process goes through the available environments. Git branching strategy and environment strategy are interrelated and define the product build process – from which branch to which environment. If the Git branching strategy and environment strategy are not coordinated, then, accordingly, the process of delivering the product to pre-production and production will not be transparent and may exclude the possibility of building a CI/CD process. \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"Define quality gates \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"heading-2\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"A quality gate is a set of step-by-step quality checks that help determine if we can proceed to the next stage or not.

This is the best practice now. If the pipeline takes longer, you need to think about how to fix it. This is where caching can help. It speeds up the CI pipeline a lot since we don't have to rebuild dependencies. On the other hand, caching introduces a certain element of instability because the cache may be invalid or outdated, which can lead to unexpected crashes. \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"Use parallel jobs \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"heading-2\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"Using parallel CI/CD jobs increases productivity.

When something goes wrong, having granularly split steps inside CI/CD and the correct logging makes finding a problem in the pipeline much easier. It becomes easier to understand what is happening and how it is happening. For example, if we produce some artifact, it would be nice to properly name it so that it is clear what it is, why it is needed, and where it came from. \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"Use a pipeline-as-code approach \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"heading-2\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"The recommended approach is to create the pipeline in YAML format or the form of JSON or some kind of executable script: it is located next to the code; it is easy for versioning and easy to change. \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"Inexperienced engineers often use a graphical interface to create a pipeline. This works well, but when something needs to be changed, questions arise: who changed it, what was changed, and when. Besides, if something went wrong after some change, it is problematic to find this change and revert it. Nowadays, almost all major platforms support the pipeline-as-code format, which allows you to write pipelines in text form. \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"It may seem difficult at the beginning of using this approach. But once you get comfortable with the syntax, it gives you more flexibility, and becomes more robust. If you need to transfer the pipeline from one project to another, then it will be just copying the file. If a graphical interface is used, it will most likely need to be recreated from scratch, where something can be forgotten, lost or overlooked. \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"Collaborate with the development team \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"heading-2\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"Automation should be in cooperation with the development team.
