          Your free trial lasts for 30 days and gives users access to all of the features of
          ReportPortal. As the free trial is associated with the Startup tier, all the limitations
          of the Startup tier (data storage, data retention policy) are applicable to the free trial
          period.

          In case you purchase a subscription on the day of the end of the free trial or before it,
          you will be able to proceed using ReportPortal. All the data reported during the free
          trial period will stay safe and remain on your project.

          If you do not purchase a subscription to one of the billing plans by the end of the trial
          or earlier, your project will be switched to read-only mode until you activate the
          subscription. Read-only mode means that during the next month after the end of the free
          trial, you will be able to use all the features except reporting functionality — you
          won&apos;t be able to report any new data into ReportPortal.

        <div>
          If the subscription is still not activated during the month after the end of the free
          trial, all your project data will be erased.
