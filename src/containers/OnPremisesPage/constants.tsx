        used prospectively; if yearly payment option is chosen, up to 12 monthly amounts of

          If Company seeks to consume more Professional Service Points than have been contracted for
          according to the Order, overage fees of 25% on a per Professional Service Point basis will
          apply.

          Professional Service Points may be used for the duration of the payment term, and expire
          at that time. For example, annual upfront payment entitles Company to use the contracted
          monthly service points at any point in the year. For a quarterly upfront payment, service
          points must be used within three months.
