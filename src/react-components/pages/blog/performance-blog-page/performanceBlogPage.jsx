      <p>
        We are glad to announce some performance optimizations in version 5.7.3.
      </p>
      <h3 className={cx('with-margin-top')}>
        1. The system capacity has increased up to 13% compared to version 5.7.2.
      </h3>
      <p>
        We updated the libraries in the scope of fixing Spring Framework Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability (Spring4Shell). As a result, the system capacity (requests per second) was increased up to 13% on the small server type* compared to version 5.7.2 during performance testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        * it is a small server type from the recommended optimal Kubernetes cluster configuration (you can check it out <a target="_blank" href="https://reportportal.io/docs/Optimal-Performance-Hardware" rel="noreferrer">here</a>).

      <h3 className={cx('with-margin-top')}>
        2. Response times for building history and filtering at all levels have become at least 18% faster compared to version 5.7.2.
      </h3>
      <p>
        5.7.3 version also brings performance optimizations in the core operations. The optimizations make basic functionality (filtering at all levels and test history building) at least 18% faster compared to version 5.7.2.

      <h3 className={cx('with-margin-top')}>
        3. RabbitMQ version updates.
      </h3>
      <p>
        We updated the RabbitMQ version from 3.9.17 to 3.10.7 and faced less RAM and CPU usage of the RabbitMQ container under the high load (more than 1 million messages in the 20 queues total).
      </p>
      <h4 className={cx('with-low-margin-top')}>
        CPU Usage : rabbitmq-0 v.3.10.5
      </h4>
      <img src={rabbitCpuNewImg} alt="New CPU usage" />
      <h4 className={cx('with-low-margin-top')}>
        Memory Usage : rabbitmq-0 v.3.10.5
      </h4>
      <img src={rabbitMemoryNewImg} alt="New memory usage" />
      <h4 className={cx('with-low-margin-top')}>
        CPU Usage : rabbitmq-0 v.3.9.17
      </h4>
      <img src={rabbitCpuOldImg} alt="Old CPU usage" />
      <h4 className={cx('with-low-margin-top')}>
        Memory Usage : rabbitmq-0 v.3.9.17
      </h4>
      <img src={rabbitMemoryOldImg} alt="Old memory usage" />
      <Notice>
        <b className={cx('blue', 'semibold')}>Benefit for the user: </b>It helps to decrease RabbitMQ resource utilization even under high workloads in the same environment just because of the version upgrade.
      </Notice>
      <p>
        Thus, thanks to performance improvements in version 5.7.3 you can speed up your reporting and decrease resources usage of the ReportPortal even under the high workload.
      </p>
      <p>
        With 5.7.3 version we are also addressing a huge list of security vulnerabilities. Please, see Release notes for details.
