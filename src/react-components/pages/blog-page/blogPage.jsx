        ElasticSearch and Data Streams

      <p>
        Storing and managing test logs inside ElasticSearch (via Data Streams) with double logging to PostgreSQL in parallel was implemented in version 5.7.2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saving logs to ElasticSearch still can be turned off after installing 5.7.2, if needed. In this case log messages will be stored in PostgreSQL only. Double logging is activated to ElasticSearch and to PostgreSQL, if there are configured settings for ElasticSearch in API and Jobs services. Please, note that settings must be added or absent for both services. A full migration of logs to ElasticSearch is planned in version 5.8. Before that, the functionality will be implemented step by step.

      <h3>
        Why we use ElasticSearch?
      </h3>
      <p>
        PostgreSQL was previously used as a database for log storage, but – according to the performance tests – this is not the most effective way. Log messages take up the most space in the database, so we decided to transfer them to ElasticSearch. Logs migration to ElasticSearch will significantly reduce storage occupied by the log table. It will improve overall database performance (time, costs).

      <h3>
        Why we use Data Streams?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Elasticsearch provides a special approach for storing log data: “A data stream lets you store append-only time series data across multiple indices while giving you a single named resource for requests. Data Streams are well-suited for logs, events, metrics, and other continuously generated data,” – described in the official elastic search documentation.

        What effort is required from users?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We recommend updating to version 5.7.2 for smooth transition of full logging to ElasticSearch, especially if you have many logs. If you update to version 5.7.2, use it for 3-4 months before version 5.8. This period will be enough for the vast of projects to generate enough logs history inside ElasticSearch. And then update to version 5.8 once it available. Since all logs will already be stored in ElasticSearch, no efforts will be required to do the migration. Along with version 5.8 we will distribute a migration script and instructions for data migration. So that you can easily migrate from early 5.x version.
