Invoices for periods less than the subscription term\n            may occasionally be issued as a convenience, but an invoice does not shorten a\n            subscription term or give any early termination right to Customer. All payments will be\n            made in United States dollars in immediately available funds. Any amounts not paid when\n            due will bear interest at a rate of 18% per annum, compounded monthly, or the maximum\n            rate permitted by law, whichever is lower. Test IO reserves the right to suspend any\n            Services or Customer access to Platform if any undisputed fees are more than 10 days\n            past due.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>7.2.

Each party\n            will only permit access to the other party’s Confidential Information to those of its or\n            its affiliates’ employees, contractors and advisors having a need to know and who have\n            signed or are bound by confidentiality obligations or agreements containing terms at\n            least as restrictive as those contained in this Agreement.

The indemnifying party may select counsel for defense of the\n            claim and direct the course of any litigation or other disputed proceedings concerning\n            the claim.
