# 7. Payments.
**7.1. Fees.**  The Customer agrees to pay the fees set forth in any Order. Unless otherwise stated in the Order, all undisputed fees are due within 14 days of the date of invoice. All Orders are non-cancelable and non-refundable unless otherwise expressly stated in this Agreement. Invoices for periods less than the subscription term may occasionally be issued as a convenience, but an invoice does not shorten a subscription term or give any early termination right to Customer. All payments will be made in United States dollars in immediately available funds. Any amounts not paid when due will bear interest at a rate of 18% per annum, compounded monthly, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower. Test IO reserves the right to suspend any Services or Customer access to Platform if any undisputed fees are more than 10 days past due.\

Upon receipt of a Dispute Notice, both parties will promptly make available appropriate personnel to work in good faith to resolve the dispute within 15 days. Upon resolution of the dispute by the parties, additional agreed amounts due from Customer, if any, in relation to the applicable invoice must be remitted to Test IO within 10 days following such resolution. If the dispute remains unresolved 60 days after the date of the invoice at issue, either party may declare the other party in breach of this Agreement and pursue any or all legal remedies available to it.\
**7.3. Taxes.**  The fees hereunder are exclusive of, and Customer will pay, any sales, use and other taxes and similar charges based on or arising from the Services or any Platform, this Agreement or its performance, other than taxes based on Test IO’s net income.
# 8. Confidentiality.
**8.1. Generally.**  “Confidential Information” will mean confidential or other non-public proprietary information that is disclosed by either party to the other under this Agreement, including without limitation, Platform, software code and designs, hardware, product specifications and documentation, financial data, business, marketing and product plans, or technology.\
**8.2. Obligations of Confidentiality.**  Each party agrees that it will hold in strict confidence and not disclose the Confidential Information of the other party to any third party and to use the Confidential Information of the other party for no purpose other than the purposes expressly permitted by this Agreement. Each party will only permit access to the other party’s Confidential Information to those of its or its affiliates’ employees, contractors and advisors having a need to know and who have signed or are bound by confidentiality obligations or agreements containing terms at least as restrictive as those contained in this Agreement. Each party will maintain the confidentiality and prevent accidental or other loss or disclosure of any Confidential Information of the other party with at least the same degree of care as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than reasonable care.\
**8.3. Exclusions from Obligations.**  A party’s obligations of confidentiality under this Agreement will not apply to information which such party can document the information (a) is in the public domain without the breach of any agreement or fiduciary duty or the violation of any law, (b) was known to the party prior to the time of disclosure without the breach of any agreement or fiduciary duty or the violation of any law, (c) is proven by contemporaneous records to be independently developed by the party prior to receiving such Confidential Information and without use or reference to the Confidential Information.\
**8.4. Legally Required Disclosure.**  In the event either party is required to disclose, pursuant to a judicial order, a requirement of a governmental agency or by operation of law, any Confidential Information provided to it by the other party then such party will provide the other party written notice of any such requirement immediately after learning of any such requirement, and take commercially reasonable measures to avoid or limit disclosure under such requirements and to obtain confidential treatment or a protective order and allow the other party to participate in the proceeding. Any disclosure will be the minimum disclosure as recommended by a party’s legal counsel and no disclosure will remove the obligations of confidentiality to any remaining Confidential Information nor permit any other disclosure of the Confidential Information in other circumstances.\
**8.5. Injunctive Relief.**  Each party recognizes and acknowledges that any use or disclosure of the Confidential Information of the other party in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement will cause the other party irreparable damage for which remedies at law may be inadequate. Accordingly, the non-breaching party will have the right to seek an immediate injunction in respect of any breach of these confidentiality obligations to obtain such relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this paragraph will not in any way limit the remedies in law or equity otherwise available to the non-breaching party.\
**8.6. Return of Confidential Information.**  Upon written request by either party hereto, the other party will promptly return all documents and other tangible materials representing the requesting party’s Confidential Information and all copies thereof, except for any archived materials that are required to be retained by law or that are not easily retrievable from secured archival systems, or records created in the ordinary course of business that are kept by a party and used only for contract compliance and enforcement purposes subject to continuing confidentiality.

**12.2.
